# Day Tripper App

### Description: 
This app lets you search nearby attractions and points of interest to plan out your next getaway. All trips will be within a day's driving distance, so no need to book a hotel. Day Tripper also allows you to save your favorite trips to access anytime in your trip diary! The app interfaces with Google Maps and Places API endpoints to fetch points of interests based on the user's inputted location. Favorite trips are accessed, saved, and deleted using the Day Tripper API.
